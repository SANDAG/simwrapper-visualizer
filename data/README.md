### <u>Model Overview:</u>

<p style="font-size:18px;">
SANDAG plans for complex mobility issues facing the 
San Diego region through the development of a long-range Regional Plan (RP). The SANDAG transportation model, an activity-based model (ABM), provides a 
systematic analytical platform so that different alternatives and inputs can be evaluated. An ABM simulates individual and household transportation 
decisions that compose their daily travel itinerary. People travel outside their home for activities 
such as work, school, shopping, healthcare, and recreation, and the ABM attempts to predict whether, 
where, when, and how this travel occurs. ABM 2+ is the most recent version of the SANDAG ABM. A peer reviewed model, it was designed for
application in the 2021 Regional Plan, a bold new vision that provides compelling alternatives to
driving.
